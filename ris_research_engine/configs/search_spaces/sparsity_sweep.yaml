# ============================================================================
# Sparsity Sweep Search Space
# ============================================================================
# Systematic exploration of measurement sparsity (M) to understand the
# trade-off between measurement overhead and prediction accuracy.
#
# Research Question: How does the number of probe measurements M affect
# beam prediction accuracy across different probe types?
#
# Total Experiments: 45 (5 sparsity levels × 3 probes × 3 seeds)
