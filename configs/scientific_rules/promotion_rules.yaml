# Promotion rules for identifying promising configurations
promote:
  - conditions:
      - metric: val_top_1_accuracy
        operator: ">"
        threshold: 0.90
    logic: and
    reason: "High accuracy - promising configuration"
  
  - conditions:
      - metric: val_top_1_accuracy
        operator: ">"
        threshold: 0.85
      - metric: model_parameters
        operator: "<"
        threshold: 100000
    logic: and
    reason: "Good accuracy with small model"
  
  - conditions:
      - metric: val_top_1_accuracy
        operator: ">"
        threshold: 0.80
      - metric: training_time_seconds
        operator: "<"
        threshold: 300
    logic: and
    reason: "Decent accuracy with fast training"
